# Weisfeiler and Leman Go Neural: Higher-order Graph Neural Networks

This is the source code for the AAAI 2019 paper **Weisfeiler and Leman Go Neural: Higher-order Graph Neural Networks** (**[Preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.02244)**).

## Installation

The code is built upon the [PyTorch Geometric package](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_geometric), which needs to be installed before running the examples.
Please follow its [installation instructions](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/installation.html).

Finally, run

```
python setup.py install
```

in the root directory of this repository. Tested with PyTorch Geometric 1.4.

## Running examples

```
cd examples
python 1-2-3-proteins.py
```
